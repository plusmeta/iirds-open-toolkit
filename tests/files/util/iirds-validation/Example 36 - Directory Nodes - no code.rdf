<!-- Example 36: Directory Nodes -->
<!-- The property iirds:has-directory-structure-type determines the type of the directory structure. The root node of a directory structure MUST have one property iirds:has-directory-structure-type. Only root nodes of a directory structure MUST have the property iirds:has-directory-structure-type. -->
<!-- NOTE -->
<!-- There is no direct relation between information units that represent navigation structures. For example, topic 1 has no direct relation to its successor topic 2. With no direct reference, iiRDS models reuse of information units in different contexts. -->
<!-- NOTE -->
<!-- iiRDS does not specify the inheritance of metadata between information units. -->
